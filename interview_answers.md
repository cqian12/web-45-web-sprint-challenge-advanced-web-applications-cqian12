Encrypt pages, require passwords, and use the latest versions of software packages.

3. Describe how web servers work.
Web servers are computers that store code for website and/or are programs running on such computers. They are connected to the internet and physically store ("host") the data for websites that users can access. When someone tries to access a site, they are really requesting something from a web server.
